### 👋 Hi there, I’m Khew Lee Yee (@LYKhew)

🎓 I'm a final-year IT student passionate about building meaningful tech solutions — from mobile apps to web platforms.  
💻 I enjoy creating apps that make life easier, such as donation systems, booking platforms, and financial tools.  
🎨 Outside of tech, I’m deeply interested in arts, music, and design.

🌱 Currently learning: Flutter, Firebase, and backend integration with PHP & MySQL  
📂 Check out my projects below – many of them are real-world assignments turned into working apps.  
💼 I'm open to internship opportunities and collaborations in software development or UI/UX.

📫 Reach me via email: [khewleeyee@gmail.com]  
😄 Pronouns: She/Her  
⚡ Fun fact: I love cats, cafe-hopping, and discovering new foods – especially shredded chicken hor fun from Ipoh 🍜
